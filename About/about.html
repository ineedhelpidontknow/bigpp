 <h1> About Us</h1> 
  <p> <div id="about us">
    Serenity Funeral Home was originally started in Dallas Texas in 1996 by Mr. CJ. He was so successful with his funeral home, and he had such awesome staff, so he decided to introduce the Serenity Choir in 1999 which got lots of support and was successful.
     Later after that he decided to open another Funeral Home in his home state Alabama. Which he later discovered it would be a good investment with the things going on there, so he opened the Birmingham location up in 2001.He also reintroduced another Serenity Choir in 2003.With all the successfulness both Serenity Funeral Homes locations decided they wanted to donate 25% to charity and they became a popular company. 
     Later in 2020 one of CJâ€™s assistants created a TikTok, Facebook, and an Instagram account which got lots of support and they received over 1 billion likes and over 5 billion views. Now CJ is investing in opening another funeral home in California.
